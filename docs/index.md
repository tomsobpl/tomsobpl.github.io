# About me

**Hello!**

I'm a Site Reliability Engineer with over 20 years of experience as a network administrator and software engineer. You can check out my professional background [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomaszsobczak/){target="_blank"}.

In my free time, I enjoy bridging the gap between legacy systems and modern software, integrating various technologies through APIs, and exploring new programming languages I haven’t worked with before. I find it fascinating to learn new paradigms, discover different approaches to problem-solving, and see how various technologies evolve over time. Experimenting with unfamiliar languages not only broadens my skill set but also gives me fresh perspectives on software development.

Recently, I decided to share some of the projects I've built and document the most interesting challenges I encounter in my work, along with their solutions. I believe that knowledge should be shared, and by writing about my experiences, I hope to create a useful resource for others in the tech community. Whether it’s troubleshooting obscure bugs, optimizing performance, or finding creative ways to integrate systems, my goal is to provide practical insights that can help others navigate similar challenges more efficiently.

Hopefully, this blog will help others save time and frustration when facing similar issues. Whether you're a seasoned engineer or just starting out, I hope you’ll find something here that sparks new ideas or offers solutions to problems you might encounter. I’d love to hear your thoughts, experiences, or even alternative approaches to the topics I cover, so feel free to join the conversation and share your insights!
